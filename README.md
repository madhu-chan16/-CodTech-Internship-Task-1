# ✅ CodTech Internship – Task 1

## 💼 Task Title:
**Create a pipeline for data preprocessing, transformation, and loading using tools like Pandas and Scikit-learn.**

---

## 📌 Description:
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** data pipeline using Python.

- 📊 Used a sample dataset with features like Name, Gender, Age, Height, and Weight.
- 🧹 Preprocessing includes handling missing values, label encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- 💾 Final processed data is saved as `processed_data.csv`.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `StandardScaler`, `LabelEncoder`, `train_test_split`

---

## 📂 Files Included:
- `CodTech_Task1_DataPipeline.ipynb` – Google Colab Notebook
- `processed_data.csv` – Cleaned and scaled dataset

---

## 🔗 Output Preview:

```csv
Name,Gender,Age,Height,Weight
-1.26,1.0,-0.25,-0.25,-1.31
